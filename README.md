# Food Recommendation System

The Food Recommendation System is an interactive platform designed to provide a personalized and holistic approach to users' nutritional needs.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Upon logging in, users are greeted with a user-friendly interface offering features such as a body fat calculator, food recommendation, and a chatbox.
- **Body Fat Calculator:** For those unfamiliar with their body fat, the system allows them to calculate it by inputting parameters like gender, age, height, and weight.
- **Food Recommendations:** Users already aware of their body fat can directly proceed to the recommendation page, where they input details such as age, weight, gender, daily activities, and goals.
- **Advanced Algorithms:** Our system utilizes advanced algorithms, including K-means clustering and Random Forest, to analyze this information and recommend a diverse range of foods tailored to different dietary requirements.
- **BMI and Calorie Target:** Users can view their BMI and target intake calories, enabling them to choose and save diet plans that align with their goals.
- **Accessibility:** Notably, users interested solely in determining their body fat percentage can access this feature without the need to log in, ensuring accessibility and a seamless user experience.
